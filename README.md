# Introduction to Engineering: Introduction to Computational Design overview

With the availability of increased computing power, many engineering disciplines now rely on utilizing computation to explore different design options. This class introduces fundamental concepts in "computationally" designing complex engineering systems. We learn computational design principles shared when designing bridges, airplane wings, and robots. The course introduces MATLAB basics and use it as a computational platform, as well as covers fundamental concepts such as a solution space, design decision variables, constraints, optimal points within the design space and searching the design space using local and global search algorithms.
